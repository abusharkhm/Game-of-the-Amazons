When I run --verbose testing/playTwo-1.in testing/playTwo-2.in, I receive the following output

Program 1 ended with: time limit exceeded waiting for opponent

The program expects a move from Program 2 but doesn't receive one, so Program 1 times out. I have been trying to debug this for a while but am lost, as I'm unable to figure out how to step by step debug this as opposed to debugging manual games which was simple. In the AG, the expected output matches my program's output - so the board is correct - but I cannot figure out why it waits for a move after declaring a winner.
